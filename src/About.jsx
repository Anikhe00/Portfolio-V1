          I'm a Design Engineer passionate about creating thoughtful, inclusive digital experiences that blend design and code. I focus on building clean, accessible interfaces that solve real problems and feel effortless to use.

          Over the past three years, I've worked across HealthTech, FinTech, SaaS, and EdTech industries, designing user-friendly workflows, building design systems, and coding with HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and JavaScript. Lately, I'm also learning ReactJS to level up my frontend skills.

          I care deeply about healthcare and enjoy exploring how design, AI, and empathy can improve the way we access care. I've also been learning motion and prototyping in Framer to bring more life to my designs.

          Outside of work, I love doodling in Procreate, watching medical dramas, geeking over F1 cars, and spending time in prayer and reflection.

        <p className="text-gray-600 text-[16px] leading-[24px] font-normal font-[Manrope]">
          I'm always open to building meaningful productsâ€”especially in healthcare or fintech. Let's create something that makes a difference.
